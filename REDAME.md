# Algorithms Society Deems Important

As you can tell by the title, I will be teaching myself some pretty common and popular algorithms you might see in the computer science world

Why am I doing this?
* I am taking CPSC 131 at CSUF and if you do not know, that class teaches you data structures
* I am impatient
* I want to get ahead of my peers
* I want to be the best, a master at this craft
* I want to make a bunch of money, and this would be one of many many many steps to put me closer to that goal
* I seem to have built a small passion for coding
* this is my third major at CSUF and when I say small passion, I mean it
